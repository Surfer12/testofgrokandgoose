# Tic Tac Toe Game Development Process

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to create and launch a Tic Tac Toe game in a browser using Mojo, Java SDKs, and magic from modular.

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

```bash
magic init tic-tac-toe --format mojoproject
cd tic-tac-toe
```

This command initializes a new Mojo project named `tic-tac-toe` with the appropriate structure for a Mojo project.

## Step 2: Create HTML and CSS Files

- **HTML**: Create `index.html` to define the game board structure.
- **CSS**: Create `styles.css` to style the game board and cells.

## Step 3: Java Backend

- **TicTacToe.java**: Implement the game logic, including move validation, win conditions, and game state management.

```java
public class TicTacToe {
    // ... (existing code)
}
```

## Step 4: Mojo for Interoperability

- **game.mojo**: Use Mojo to handle communication between the Java backend and the frontend.

```mojo
from java import TicTacToe

def handle_move(row, col):
    // ... (existing code)

def check_winner(board):
    // ... (existing code)
```

## Step 5: JavaScript for Frontend

- **game.js**: Implement the frontend logic to handle user interactions and communicate with the backend.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // ... (existing code)
});
```

## Step 6: Launch in Browser

```bash
magic run
python mojo tic-tac-toe
```

This command starts a simple HTTP server to serve the game. Access the game by navigating to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Step 7: Debugging

- **launch.json**: Configure the launch settings for debugging the Java backend and launching the browser.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "java",
            "name": "Debug Tic Tac Toe",
            "request": "launch",
            "mainClass": "com.example.tictactoe.TicTacToe",
            "projectName": "tic-tac-toe",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        },
        {
            "type": "chrome",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Browser",
            "url": "http://localhost:8080",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Step 8: Project Management

- **magic**: Use `magic` from modular to manage the project structure and dependencies.

```bash
magic init tic-tac-toe --format mojoproject
magic add <dependency>
magic install
magic update
magic upgrade
magic build
magic shell
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create and launch a Tic Tac Toe game in a browser using Mojo, Java SDKs, and magic from modular. If you encounter any issues, please refer to this document or reach out for assistance.

````markdown:tic-tac-toe/docs/rules.md
# Project Creation Rules

## Rule 1: Language and Interoperability

- **Always use Mojo and never Python**: Use Mojo as the primary language for project development. Utilize the interoperability of Python, Mojo, and Java where needed. **Python can be used for scripting or data analysis, while Java SDKs are used for specific integrations.**

## Rule 2: Java SDKs

- **Always use Java SDKs from LLM Providers**: Ensure that any Java SDKs used in the project are sourced from LLM Providers. **Ensure compatibility with Mojo, and document any known issues or workarounds.**

## Rule 3: Project Management

- **Always use magic from modular as a Python project manager**: Use magic from modular to manage the project structure and dependencies. **This tool was chosen for its seamless integration with Mojo and its ability to handle complex project structures.**

  - **Initialize the Project**: Use `magic init` to set up the project structure.
  - **Add Dependencies**: Use `magic add` to add necessary dependencies.
  - **Install Dependencies**: Use `magic install` to install all dependencies.
  - **Update Dependencies**: Use `magic update` to update dependencies as recorded in the local lock file.
  - **Upgrade Dependencies**: Use `magic upgrade` to update packages to the latest possible version, disregarding the manifest version constraints.
  - **Build the Project**: Use `magic build` to compile or build the project.
  - **Create a Shell Environment**: Use `magic shell` to create a shell environment with all the necessary dependencies and configurations for your project.

## Rule 4: Directive Continuation

- **Always continue with the directive unless canceled by the user**: Follow the outlined process unless explicitly canceled by the user. **To cancel, use the command `cancel directive`.**

## Rule 5: Personalization

- **Always call me Ryan, that's me, a unique human!**: Address me as Ryan in all communications and documentation. 

## Rule 6: Debugging

- **Always use launch.json for debugging**: Configure the `launch.json` file to set up debugging for Java and browser launching.

## Rule 7: Documentation

- **Always document known issues and workarounds**: Document any known issues or workarounds related to Java SDKs, Mojo, or project management tools.

```

{{ These updates ensure that the project documentation reflects the use of `magic` for project management, the configuration of `launch.json` for debugging, and the importance of documenting known issues and workarounds. }}
