# Tic Tac Toe Game Development Process

## Overview

This document outlines the steps to create and launch a Tic Tac Toe game in a browser using Mojo, Java SDKs, and magic from modular.

## Step 1: Initialize the Project

magic init tic-tac-toe --format mojoproject
cd tic-tac-toe

This command initializes a new Mojo project named `tic-tac-toe` with the appropriate structure for a Mojo project.

## Step 2: Create HTML and CSS Files

- **HTML**: Create `index.html` to define the game board structure.
- **CSS**: Create `styles.css` to style the game board and cells.

## Step 3: Java Backend

- **TicTacToe.java**: Implement the game logic, including move validation, win conditions, and game state management.

public class TicTacToe {
    // ... (existing code)
}

## Step 4: Mojo for Interoperability

- **game.mojo**: Use Mojo to handle communication between the Java backend and the frontend.

from java import TicTacToe

def handle_move(row, col):
    // ... (existing code)

def check_winner(board):
    // ... (existing code)

## Step 5: JavaScript for Frontend

- **game.js**: Implement the frontend logic to handle user interactions and communicate with the backend.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    // ... (existing code)
});

## Step 6: Launch in Browser

magic run
python mojo tic-tac-toe

This command starts a simple HTTP server to serve the game. Access the game by navigating to `localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create and launch a Tic Tac Toe game in a browser using Mojo, Java SDKs, and magic from modular. If you encounter any issues, please refer to this document or reach out for assistance.
